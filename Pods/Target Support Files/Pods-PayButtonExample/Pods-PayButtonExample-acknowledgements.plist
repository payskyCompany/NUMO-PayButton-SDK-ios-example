			<string>## PaySky Button SDK

The purpose of this SDK to help programmers to use PaySky payment SDK for IOS .

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
1-COCOPODS installed on your machine   .
2-Xcode
3-Create new IOS project in xcode to use SDK or if you have created a project before with swit
```

### Installing

A step by step that tell you how to get our SDK in your project.

```
1- open your xcode project.
2- in your project in Podfile in project level  add :-
pod 'PayButton'
3- open your terminal in project path and write this command:-
(for first try)
- pod deintegrate
- pod update
(for second try)
- pod install


### Using SDK

```
in order to use our SDK you should get merchant id and Terminal id from our company.

1-import PayButton
2 â€“ create a new instance from PayButton:-  

 let paymentViewController = PaymentViewController ()

you need to just pass some parameters to PayButton class instance :-
  1-Merchat id.
  2-Terminal id.
  3-Payment amount.
  4-Currency code [Optional].
  5-merchant secure hash.
  6-transaction Reference Number.
  
Note That:-
you shoud keep your secure hash and merchant id and terminal id with encryption before save them in storage if you want.

Example:-


        paymentViewController.amount =  "amount"  // Amount
        paymentViewController.delegate = self // PaymentDelegate
        paymentViewController.mId = "merchantId" // Merchant id
        paymentViewController.tId = "terminalId" // Terminal  id
        paymentViewController.Currency = "currencyCode" // Currency Code [Optional]
        paymentViewController.refnumber = "reference number""  // unique transaction reference number.
        paymentViewController.Key = "Merchant secure hash" // merchant secrue hash
        paymentViewController.pushViewController()

       
2 - in order to create transaction call back in deleget PaymentDelegate:-

    implete deleget on your ViewController
    class ViewController: UIViewController, PaymentDelegate  {\
        var receipt: TransactionStatusResponse = TransactionStatusResponse()

        func finishSdkPayment(_ receipt: TransactionStatusResponse) {
        self.receipt = receipt
        if receipt.Success {

            LabeResoinse.setTitle("Transaction completed successfully, click here to show callback result", for: .normal)
            
        }else {
            LabeResoinse.setTitle("Transaction has been failed click to callback callback ", for: .normal)


            
        }
    }


    }


to create transaction in our sdk you just call createTransaction method and pass to it
PaymentTransactionCallback listener to call it after transaction.
this listener has 2 methods:-

  1 - finishSdkPayment method
      this method called in case transaction success by card payment with SuccessfulCardTransaction object.
      SuccessfulCardTransaction object from create transaction listener contains:-
      NetworkReference variable that is reference number of transaction.
      AuthCode variable
      ActionCode variable.
      ReceiptNumber variable.
      amount variable.
      
  2 - finishSdkPayment method 
      this method is called if customer make a wallet transaction with SuccessfulWalletTransaction object.
      SuccessfulWalletTransaction object from create transaction listener contains:-
      NetworkReference variable that is reference number of transaction.
      amount variable.
      


  
Example:- 

           func finishSdkPayment(_ receipt: TransactionStatusResponse) {
         if receipt.Success   // will be true if transaction success 
         {
          print(receipt.NetworkReference)
         }else{
          print(receipt.Message) // resonse of error

         }
    }

```


## Deployment

2-you should keep your merchant id and terminal id secured
in your project, encrypt them before save them in project.
